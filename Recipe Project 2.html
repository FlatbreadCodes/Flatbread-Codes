  <h1>Easy Shrimp and Grits</h1>
    <p>This Classic Shrimp and Grits recipe is SO easy, SO simple, and the ULTIMATE Southern comfort food. This traditional low country recipe uses bacon and is served with a simple sauce and uses stone-ground grits with cheese (but it’s easy to adapt to have no bacon, or other flavors and ingredients). And the whole thing only takes 30 minutes to make!</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>2 1/2 cups chicken broth divided</li>
          <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
          <li>4 tablespoons butter divided</li>
          <li>3/4 cup stone-ground grits</li>
          <li>1 cup sharp cheddar cheese shredded</li>
          <li>4 strips bacon (or 2-3 thick-cut slices)</li>
          <li>1 lb. jumbo shrimp peeled and deveined</li>
          <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
          <li>black pepper to taste</li>
          <li>thinly sliced green onions for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Bring 2 cups of the chicken broth, the milk (2 cups), 3 tablespoons of the butter, and a pinch of salt to a gentle boil in a medium sized pot. Add the grits and whisk together. Simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until grits are soft and creamy, whisking every few minutes. Cover and set aside off heat – they will finish softening up while they sit.</li>
        <li>Cook the 4 bacon strips until crispy in a nonstick or cast iron skillet. Set aside on a paper towel lined plate. Once cool, chop into small pieces.
</li>
        <li>Drain all but 2 tablespoons of the bacon grease from the skillet.</li>
        <li>Rinse the shrimp with cold water and pat dry. Season with salt and pepper, and any other spices you want to add (optional). Cook in the bacon grease until only just cooked- about 2 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining tablespoon of butter and 1/2 cup of chicken broth to the shrimp and stir until melted and broth is heated.</li>
        <li>Stir in the cheese to the grits (1 cup) until melted.</li>
        <li>Serve the shrimp mixture over the grits, making sure to spoon some of the liquid from the skillet over the grits, and sprinkle with the bacon pieces and sliced green onions, if using. Serve immediately.</li>
      </ol>
